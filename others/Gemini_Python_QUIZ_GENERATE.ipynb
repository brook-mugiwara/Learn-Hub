Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, while average velocity is the displacement divided by the total time taken. Displacement is the vector quantity that describes the change in position of an object, while distance is the scalar quantity that describes the length of the path traveled.It is possible for average speed and velocity to have the same magnitude but different directions. This can happen when the object is moving in a closed path, such as a circle. In this case, the displacement is zero, so the average velocity is also zero. However, the distance traveled is not zero, so the average speed is not zero.For example, consider a car that is traveling around a circular track. The car's average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. The car's average velocity is the displacement divided by the total time taken. Since the car is moving in a closed path, the displacement is zero. Therefore, the average velocity is also zero.

Velocity is a measure of the object's speed and direction.It is possible for an object to have a constant speed while its acceleration is not zero. This occurs when the object is moving in a circular path at a constant speed. In this case, the object's velocity is constantly changing as it moves around the circle, even though its speed remains constant.An example of this is a car driving around a circular track. The car's speed is constant, but its velocity is constantly changing as it moves around the track.
